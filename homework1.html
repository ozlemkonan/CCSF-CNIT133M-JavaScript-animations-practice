Creative, hard working web designer who is often more likely to be a software developer who works with programming languages to create a higher level of interactions on a website such as the integration with a database systemstands out. Seeking to contribute a company and improve skills at the same time. Have a unique mix of creavity, time managment, problem solving, and technical skill, proven by 10 years sales and project management experinces. Excellent communicator, quick to grasp the bigger picture.</p>
<p class="p2">Iâ€™ve started the college being an UX-UI designer then met programming which has been become a passionate endeavor for me. Developing mobile web has a more direct impact on the end user. I took HTLM-CSS and JavaScript classes last semester. I struggled to build mobile version of my final project in last semester then really curious about learning mobile web development. And also want to finish my certificate program at CCSF. Looking forward to reaching more knowledge and doing more practice.</p>




<h2>Technologies for this class</h2>

</ul>
<h2> Resources </h2>

<ul>

       
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="web">W3Schools</a> is a tutorials website, but they are more brief and reference-like. They also have dedicated reference pages for most web development languages. Their format is very good. For each language reference, they have a sidebar with a list of pages, so it is very easy to find what you are looking for.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="web">Codecademy</a> is the one if you prefer learning interactively. You have to pass simple tasks and you keep learning. This is good if you learn one technology at a time.</li>
        <li><a href="https://devdocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="web">DevDocs</a> is has many different languages (not only web development), from very popular ones to lesser-known ones. It is similar to W3Schools that reference is really great and in-depth.</li>
